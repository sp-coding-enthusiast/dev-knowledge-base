# C# Types

## Struct vs Class vs Record (Layman Explanation + Use Cases)

---

## Big Picture (In Simple Words)

In C#, **Struct**, **Class**, and **Record** are ways to create your own data types.

Think of them like **containers** for data and behavior, but each is designed for a **different purpose**.

---

## One-Line Understanding

* **Struct** → Small, simple data (copied by value)
* **Class** → Objects with identity and behavior (copied by reference)
* **Record** → Objects where data matters more than identity (immutable by default)

---

## Struct

### What is a Struct?

A **struct** is a lightweight data container.

### Layman Explanation

> A struct is like a **photocopy**. When you pass it around, you get a copy, not the original.

### Key Characteristics

* Value type
* Stored mostly on stack
* Copied when passed to methods
* Cannot inherit from another struct or class
* Good for small data

### Example

```csharp
struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;
}

Point p1 = new Point { X = 10, Y = 20 };
Point p2 = p1;   // copy created
p2.X = 50;

// p1.X is still 10
```

### When to Use Struct

* Coordinates (Point, Vector)
* Date, Time
* Small, immutable data
* Performance-critical code

---

## Class

### What is a Class?

A **class** is a reference type used to model real-world objects.

### Layman Explanation

> A class is like a **shared remote control**. Everyone points to the same object.

### Key Characteristics

* Reference type
* Stored on heap
* Passed by reference
* Supports inheritance
* Supports polymorphism

### Example

```csharp
class Person
{
    public string Name;
}

Person p1 = new Person { Name = "Amit" };
Person p2 = p1;   // same reference
p2.Name = "Rahul";

// p1.Name is now "Rahul"
```

### When to Use Class

* Business entities
* Services
* Domain models
* Objects with identity

---

## Record

### What is a Record?

A **record** is a special type of class focused on **data**, not identity.

### Layman Explanation

> A record is like a **form** — two forms are equal if the content is equal.

### Key Characteristics

* Reference type (by default)
* Immutable by default
* Value-based equality
* Supports with-expressions

### Example

```csharp
public record Employee(string Name, int Age);

var e1 = new Employee("Neha", 30);
var e2 = new Employee("Neha", 30);

Console.WriteLine(e1 == e2); // true
```

### Immutability Example

```csharp
var e3 = e1 with { Age = 31 };
```

## Key Differences (Interview Table)

| Feature     | Struct             | Class        | Record               |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Type        | Value              | Reference    | Reference            |
| Equality    | By value           | By reference | By value             |
| Mutability  | Mutable by default | Mutable      | Immutable by default |
| Inheritance | No                 | Yes          | Yes                  |
| Memory      | Stack (mostly)     | Heap         | Heap                 |

## Real-Life Analogy

| Type   | Analogy       |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Struct | Photocopy     |
| Class  | Shared remote |
| Record | Filled form   |

---

## When to Use What (Very Important)

| Scenario                         | Use    |
| -------------------------------- | ------ |
| Small data, performance critical | Struct |
| Business object with identity    | Class  |
| DTOs, API models, immutable data | Record |

---

## Interview-Friendly Answer

> Structs are value types used for small data. Classes are reference types used for objects with identity and behavior. Records are reference types designed for immutable data with value-based equality, commonly used for DTOs and API models.

---

## One-Line Summary

**Struct = small data, Class = object with identity, Record = immutable data-focused object.**
